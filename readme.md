Lambda Kernel for the LG G2
==========================

> Thereâ€™s only one horizon, yet it can be found.

A general purpose custom Kernel for the **LG G2** that embraces freedom and speed on a **CAF** oriented shape.

Information
-------------------------

- Linux version: **3.4.112**
- Dorimanx's toolchain: **GCC 5.4**
- Android targets: **Marhsmallow** - **Nougat**
- Packager: **AnyKernel2**

Dependencies
-------------------------

As any other **Linux Kernel**, it depends on other software to compile it. I'll list them per GNU operating system distributions:

###### Fedora/CentOS/RHEL

You'll need to install the development tools group at first.

	sudo dnf group install 'Development Tools'

It's worth installing **ncurses** in case you want to change the configuration from a **GUI**.

	sudo dnf install ncurses-devel

You might also need some compression and device tree tools like lz4, ccache and dtc.

	sudo dnf install lz4 lz4-devel dtc ccache

###### Ubuntu/Debian

I don't use Ubuntu but the dependencies are generically the same with a couple differences in naming or versioning. In Ubuntu, you will need to setup source dependencies by going to **System Settings > Software and Update** and then checking the box for source code. The basic set of programs needed might be achieved with the following command.

	sudo apt-get install build-essential libncurses5 libncurses5-dev libelf-dev binutils-dev liblz4-tool ccache device-tree-compiler open-jdk-8-jdk git
	sudo apt-get build-dep build-essential libncurses5 libncurses5-dev libelf-dev binutils-dev # This step may be needed for VM environments.
	
###### Arch Linux

If you're running Arch Linux you probably already have the dependencies needed, in any case you can install them running:

	sudo pacman -S base-devel kmod inetutils bc libelf

If you really follow the K.I.S.S. principle you'll probably only need the **base-devel** and it's present in 99% of the installations.

As of now, fully cacche support must be present to compile the kernel as well as the device tree parser. Also, if the host kernel was not compressed with lz4, you might not have that package installed, install it if you don't.

	sudo pacman -S dtc ccache lz4

###### Unconventional

Distributions of **GNU/Linux** that I call _unconventional_: **Funtoo**, **Gentoo**, **Sabayon** and **Slackware**. They can also be called as source based distros.
Since you need to **compile** the Kernel yourself when _chrooting_ in the core of the system, the dependencies were already pulled and compiled during the installation.

Here's a brief exchange of the tools you'll need on **Gentoo**:

	su
	emerge --sync
	emerge ccache # Located in dev-util/ccache.
	emerge lz4 # Located in app-arch/lz4.
	emerge dtc # Located in sys-apps/dtc.

You can also punch everything into one single command, compat or declare the ebuild path at will. It's up to you.

Compilation
-------------------------

###### Obligatory

Create a development folder if you don't have one yet.

	mkdir Development && cd Development # Name it as you'd like, this is not hardcoded.

Create the kernel folder inside the development folder.

	mkdir -p kernel/lambda # To avoid conflicts with any other kernel you might already have.
	cd kernel/lambda

We have an automated downloader script to get everything needed per **Android** version to be checked out after sync. Currently, anykernel is the only repo that benefits of this branch selector since the kernel is **common** for all both **Android** versions.

	curl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/GalaticStryder/d4f189e6dac50f755f2c5e1e7dcdad92/raw/886ff1cc57a0f19b7af71a22e3d14861ad394be0/sync-lambda.sh | sh

###### Optional

This script uses **HTTPS** protocol. It's also possible that you want to use **git**. You'll need to **wget** the script locally and edit to use that protocol.

	wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/GalaticStryder/d4f189e6dac50f755f2c5e1e7dcdad92/raw/886ff1cc57a0f19b7af71a22e3d14861ad394be0/sync-lambda.sh
	chmod sync-lambda.sh
	$EDITOR sync-lambda.sh

Change the __https://github.com/__ to __git@github.com:__ in both cloning processes.

###### Obligatory

And then finally, download the **GCC compiler**. Also known as **toolchain**.

###### Example

A fair advise, the current state of **Lambda Kernel** on this particular device **will not** allow the usage of old toolchains. Though you can use this **Linaro 4.9** __example__ to download your own **custom** toolchain. If I were you I'd just skip to the next instruction block.

	mkdir -p toolchains/linaro/4.9
	git clone https://github.com/Christopher83/arm-cortex_a15-linux-gnueabihf-linaro_4.9 toolchains/linaro/4.9 # Don't follow this command at all!

Modify the **build-anykernel** script to point to your custom toolchain following the Linaro 4.9 **example** as well.

###### Obligatory

The **"right"** toolchain we use for this particular device comes from **@dorimanx**, you **must** use it as of now.

	# OBS: Dorimanx's toolchain is hosted in his own LG G2 kernel.
	cd lge_msm8974
	mkdir -p ../toolchains
	git remote add dorimanx https://github.com/dorimanx/DORIMANX_LG_STOCK_LP_KERNEL
	git fetch dorimanx master
	git checkout dorimanx/master # This will get into dorimanx kernel tree.
	cp -R android-toolchain/ ../toolchains/
	mv ../toolchains/android-toolchain ../toolchains/dorimanx # This is just a renaming method.
	git checkout lambda # This will get into lambda kernel tree back again.

Finally everything will be settled down and ready to compile, just **run**:

	./build-anykernel.sh

Follow the on-screen guide to compile your variant for a given **Android** version compatibility.
