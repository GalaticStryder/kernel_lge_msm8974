Simple MSM thermal driver (MSM_THERMAL_SIMPLE)

MSM_THERMAL_SIMPLE is a kernel platform driver which regulates thermal conditions
on the device in the absence of an equivalent userspace daemon. The goal of
MSM_THERMAL_SIMPLE is to prevent the temperature of the system from exceeding
a thermal limit at which it cannot operate. The MSM_THERMAL_SIMPLE driver polls
an appropriate ADC channel, and reduces the maximum CPU frequency allowed in steps,
to limit power/thermal output when a threshold temperature is crossed. It restores
the maximum CPU frequency allowed in the same stepwise fashion when the threshold
temperature is cleared.

The devicetree representation of the MSM_THERMAL_SIMPLE block should be:

Required properties

- compatible: "qcom,msm-thermal-simple"
- qcom,thermal-vadc: The phandle to the VADC device to use
- qcom,adc-channel: The ADC channel to poll from on the VADC device; a full
		list of valid channels is available in include/linux/qpnp/qpnp-adc.h,
		inside the qpnp_vadc_channels enumeration.

Example:

	qcom,msm-thermal-simple {
		compatible = "qcom,msm-thermal-simple";
		qcom,thermal-vadc = <&pm8941_vadc>;
		qcom,adc-channel = <178>;
	};
